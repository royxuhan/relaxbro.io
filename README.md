Relax, bro! helps you relax and chill out. The web-app notifies you via a text message sent from Twillio when the detected speech sentiment is bad!

The backend uses Google Cloud APIs (Speech to Text, NLP) to convert speech and detect sentiment, and th frontend is coded in Bootstrap.

To run the app, simply clone the repo and run index.html in the templates folder. The instructions are on the web page.
